# Checkers - CS451 Project

	Checkers is a multiplayer game which provides an environment for two distant players to play against each other over the internet. This environment will be user-friendly and realistic as much as possible, just like two players playing on the same physical board. The application is intended to run on personal computers in a local host environment.

## Usage

Download all the files.
Open terminal and type java -jar checkers.java.
Choose how to run the game, either host or join. Make sure you’re in the same network, i.e. local network.
Viola!
